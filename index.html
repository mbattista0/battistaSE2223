                        Disabled individuals and the injured often face accessibility issues and difficulty when performing day-to-day tasks.
                        For an individual with function in only one hand, certain standing electric can opener models that require two hands to lock and unlock cans in place are not accessible and cannot be used.
                        This research aimed to develop a novel, easy-to-use, cost-effective auxiliary device to allow use of a previously-owned can opener with only one hand.
                        Components of the device were modeled in Autodesk Fusion 360 (CAD software) and 3D printed on several printer units.
                        After assembly and some preparation, the device's function and effectiveness were tested with human participants who volunteered to attach and detach cans from a
                            can opener under a variety of circumstances with both hands and one hand. The time taken was measured for analysis, and acceleration data was also recorded to observe unintended movement of the device.
                        Statistical analysis indicated that while the operation of the can opener did take significantly longer with the device than with both hands, the times measured with the auxiliary device did fall well below
                            (approximately 55% of) the 60-second maximum chosen as a design constraint. Overall, multiple improvements can be made, but the design was functional as a first prototype and did accomplish the engineering goal.

                        <strong>Excerpt:</strong> It is important to ensure that disabled individuals are able to live as normal a life as possible, even with their disabilities.
                        Seniors, injured persons, and the permanently impaired have a great disadvantage when it comes to performing daily tasks, so technologies have been developed to assist them in various ways.
                        However, there remains room for improvement in many areas.
                        One area currently lacking is the can opener. Canned food accounts for a considerable portion of the food intake in the United States and around the world, and research has shown that canned food use can lead to balanced, nutrient-filled diets, more so than individuals who do not use canned food.
                        This is even more applicable with disabilities and in old age; American households with a person aged 65 or older spend, on average, 62% more on canned fruits per person than households without.
                        This is a significant statistic because seniors are more likely to suffer from health problems like arthritis that may impact their ability to perform daily tasks.
                        ...
                        Elderly individuals with arthritis and similar conditions, people with short- and long-term disabilities, and others who may otherwise be impaired would likely benefit from a solution enabling them to continue using a previously-owned standing electric can opener.
                        As opposed to developing a can opener adapted for one-handed use, which already exists in various forms, an accessory for existing openers would be of use because it would be more cost-effective for both short- and long-term use, a consideration that is important due to the many extra costs that disabled individuals incur.

                        Research Practicum is a sophomore-year course at High Technology High School in Lincroft, NJ.
                        Students choose a topic of interest and work with a mentor to conduct novel research and communicate results.
                        Many research students at HTHS go on to compete in regional, national, and international research competitions.
